# Reflecting on *Practicing the Way* by John Mark Comer

Years ago, my pastor in Austin introduced me to a phrase that has stayed with me: **"spiritual bloat."** It describes the state of consuming spiritual content—sermons, Bible studies, and worship experiences—without actively practicing the teachings of Jesus. This idea resonates deeply with Paul’s words: *“It is more blessed to give than to receive”* (Acts 20:35). Faith, after all, isn’t just something we hold onto but something we live out. Paul also likens faith to training for a race: *“Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one gets the prize? Run in such a way as to get the prize”* (1 Corinthians 9:24). James takes it a step further, reminding us that *“faith without works is dead”* (James 2:17). These passages highlight the active, dynamic nature of faith—something Comer captures beautifully in this book.

The title, *Practicing the Way*, draws from the concept of apprenticeship. Jesus, known not only as the Son of God but also as a Rabbi, called ordinary people—fishermen, tax collectors, and zealots—to follow Him as disciples. In Jesus’ time, disciples were typically well-versed in the Torah and aspired to become like their rabbi in every way. Comer invites us to imagine the same goal today: to become like Jesus through the empowerment of the Holy Spirit, bringing heaven to earth in both ordinary and extraordinary ways.

One of the most compelling aspects of Comer’s writing is how he draws inspiration from monastic traditions. For instance, monks would keep a skull in their study—whether real or symbolic—as a reminder of their mortality. This practice emphasized living with eternity in mind, making every moment count for God’s glory (*Psalm 90:12*). This contrasts starkly with our Western culture, which idolizes youth, experiences, and the here-and-now. It’s a perspective that challenges our priorities and invites deeper reflection. For example, I couldn’t help but think of billionaires like Larry Ellison, whose obsession with [anti-aging research](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/anti-aging-fanatic-bryan-johnson-075200263.html)underscores how our culture struggles with the concept of death.

Comer also explores the upside-down nature of God’s Kingdom, where greatness is found in service: *“For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life as a ransom for many”* (Mark 10:45). This countercultural mindset calls us to live not for self-glorification but for others’ benefit and God’s glory.

One of the book’s standout moments is its reference to the "stages of faith," as outlined in Fuller Seminary’s stage theory of spiritual maturity:
1. Recognition of God  
2. Life of discipleship  
3. Productive life  
4. Journey inward  
5. Journey outward  
6. Life of love  

Comer observes that many Christians never progress beyond stage three, a sobering reminder of how easy it is to stagnate in our spiritual growth. True transformation, however, happens when we press further—into the inward and outward journeys of faith, culminating in a life defined by love (*1 Corinthians 13:13*).

A particularly challenging quote comes from Dietrich Bonhoeffer, referenced in the book:  
> *“Those who love their dream of a Christian community more than they love the Christian community itself become destroyers of that Christian community.”*  

This struck a chord with me. It’s easy to idolize an ideal vision of community and miss the beauty and diversity of the real, messy people God calls us to love. Each church has its unique emphasis—whether on missions, local outreach, or Sabbath practices—and while approaches may differ, the Bible provides rich and varied guidance for living out our faith.

The book offers actionable steps, but Comer cautions against legalism. Love, he reminds us, is the true measure of our actions: *“If I speak in the tongues of men or of angels but do not have love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal”* (1 Corinthians 13:1). A seemingly noble act, if done with bitterness or pride, loses its meaning.

Comer introduces a framework for living out the practices of Jesus in daily life, including:  
- **Sabbath**  
- **Prayer**  
- **Fasting**  
- **Solitude**  
- **Generosity**  
- **Scripture**  
- **Community**  
- **Service**  
- **Witness**  

These practices are deeply countercultural, particularly in our hustle-driven world. For example, truly observing the Sabbath requires cutting out distractions—sports, streaming shows, and even well-intentioned career pursuits. While these sacrifices may seem significant, they pale in comparison to the eternal rest and joy promised in Christ (*Hebrews 4:9-11*).

*Practicing the Way* is a book I’ll revisit often, as its message challenges me to align my life more closely with Jesus’ teachings. I’m grateful to the Fort Bend County Library for carrying this book and others by John Mark Comer, making these transformative ideas accessible.
