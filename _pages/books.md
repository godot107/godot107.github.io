**Welcome to My Book Review Space**

Here, I share thoughts and reflections on books I've read, many of which are borrowed from the public library. For me, books are more than stories or lessons—they are conversations. They invite us to engage with new ideas, wrestle with different perspectives, and ultimately reach our own conclusions. As John Mark Comer beautifully puts it, "Reading a book invites the writer’s thoughts to your mind." I hope my reviews inspire you to explore, reflect, and discover your own insights through reading.
