Using the CSV exported from a previous project using SQL, I continued to make more sophisticated graphs using ggplot with R studio.  The information presented represents real data of players that participated in the 2015 NBA Playoffs.  Again, I used basketball-reference.com to procure the raw data.

Here are the results:

Includes: R code, Original Data, and Copy of Graphs

Looking ahead:
I will continue to plot more advanced graphs.
In addition, I want to feature more interaction with graphs where one could run the R code and interact with plots to expand with more detailed information.
Another possible interaction may include a search feature of some sort that accepts user input.  A simple means of that is to incorporate functions in the R code first.
