**Celebrating Four Years with Lady Bird**
April 1st marks four years since we brought home our rescue dog, Lady Bird. No joke - April Fools' Day became the start of a heartfelt journey. Adopting a rescue dog is a leap of faith; you're taking on an unknown history, and Lady Bird came with her share of challenges, especially separation anxiety.
Understanding Separation Anxiety
Until you've experienced a dog with separation anxiety, it's hard to grasp the weight it adds to daily life. Lady Bird had been through at least five homes before finding her forever home with us. Interestingly, we even ran into one of her previous foster owners in our apartment building - a small world indeed. To help Lady Bird adjust, we sought professional help from a separation anxiety consultant. The process involved structured exercises, gradually increasing the time she spent alone, starting with just a few minutes.

**Memorable Incidents and Challenges**
Lady Bird's separation anxiety has led to some memorable incidents:
-She tore up blinds.

-Opened the bottom freezer door by pulling it out. And taken the liberty to eat my chicken tenders!
-Managed to turn on a stove burner.
-Opened kitchen cabinets and pulled out items like an Instant Pot lid.
-Bit into plants.
-Climbed onto furniture to peer out the window.
-Lady Bird peering out of window
-Knocked down pillows.
-Broke through her crate.
-Tore into door molding.

She's also scared of fireworks and thunderstorms, and she loves chasing small animals - very normal dog behaviors! Despite all this, she's made progress. We've learned to control her environment by lifting blinds and removing temptations. To track her progress, we've diligently logged every time we left her home alone.

**Lessons in Patience and Emotional Growth**
Lady Bird has taught us patience and, in many ways, helped prepare us for the arrival of our newborn. She has a soft, gentle energy and would never hurt anyone. I'd like to think she has emotional intelligence - when a guest is sharing something difficult, she'll lean her body against them as if to offer comfort.

**Lady Bird and Kids**
Lady Bird is wonderful with kids. They treat her like a petting zoo animal, and she patiently endures until she needs a break. When she's had enough, she'll retreat under the table or to one of her three beds around the house.

**A Community Effort**

Raising a dog like Lady Bird takes a village, and we're incredibly grateful for our extended family. They're always willing to dogsit, even for long intervals, and their own rescue Border Collie reflects their big hearts and passion for animals.

**Why Adopt a Dog?**

Adopting a dog is not for everyone, but if you want to make a difference, celebrate breakthroughs, and enjoy the loyalty of a constant companion, it's worth it. Lady Bird has been our fitness accountability partner, a source of laughter with her quirks, a zero-waste helper by eating leftovers, and a snuggle buddy on the couch.
