My Baking Journey

I discovered my love for baking after binge-watching a few seasons of *The Great British Bake Off*. It wasn’t just the charming accents or the intricate desserts that drew me in—it was the warmth and connection that baking seemed to inspire. 

## Why I Started Baking

My journey into baking was also partly health-motivated. I wanted to reduce my intake of processed foods, especially after learning about the hidden ingredients in store-bought bread. If you’ve ever looked up **“ultra-processed bread”** on YouTube, you know how unsettling it can be. One eye-opening example ([link here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYi-7iaqmHk)) highlights just how lenient FDA regulations can be compared to those in Canada or the EU.

## Inspiration from Bake Off

One of my favorite moments from the show was when a contestant baked a cake for their coworkers. The joy radiating from their faces was contagious, even through the screen. It reminded me of my own experiences at work, where talented colleagues would bring in homemade treats like **Texas sheet cakes** or **carrot cakes** for birthdays and holidays. Those gestures always created a sense of community and shared happiness.

## Baking as a Connection

For me, baking is much more than saving a few dollars or avoiding a trip to the bakery. It’s about the connections it fosters. When I bake for friends, family, or neighbors, I see the joy and appreciation light up their faces. There’s something uniquely heartwarming about sharing a loaf of bread or a batch of cookies with someone. It’s a simple yet powerful gesture of goodwill—a way to build bridges and strengthen bonds.

## The Art and Science of Baking

Over time, I’ve developed a deep appreciation for the art and science of baking. It’s incredibly diverse, shaped by geography, culture, and ingredients. You could spend a lifetime mastering the craft and still have so much left to explore. While I’ve dabbled in making:

- Cookies
- Croissants
- Bread loaves
- Cardamom buns
- Baguettes
- Bagels

I’ve also burned my fair share of batches. Each mistake has been a valuable lesson, making the journey all the more rewarding.

## Would I Open a Bakery?

People often ask if I’d ever open a bakery. While the idea is appealing, the reality of time constraints, administrative hurdles like licensing, and the upfront capital make it unlikely. That said, I have a newfound respect for the bakers who dedicate themselves to the craft and run successful bakeries.

## Baking at Home

Baking at home, however, has its own special charm. It’s like knitting—every step of the process involves thinking about the recipient. The time and effort you invest in kneading dough or perfecting a recipe communicates care and thoughtfulness in a way that store-bought goods simply can’t.
